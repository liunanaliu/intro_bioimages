an image is just a matrix of numbers, 

pixel is picture element

the edges between pixels are an artefact, in reality, they do not exist!

pixel size is a digital property of am image

you configure it durinng the imaging session at the microscope.

it is not resolution!!!

resolution is a property of your image system.

the measure of how close object can be in an image while still being differebtiable, called spatial resolution.

a bit is the smallest memory unit in computers, atomic data.

the bit-depth n enumerates how many different intensity values are present in an image: 2nd grey values

in microscopy, images are usually stored as 8, 12 or 16-bit images

when working with 8-bit images, 256 different gray values can be saved.

lookup table decides how the images is displayed on screen.
so choose visualization of your color tables wisely.

a histogram shows the probability distribution of pixel intensities,
is a summary if images

the probabilty of a pixel having a certain grey value can be measured by counting pixels and 
calculating the frequency of the given intensity

whenever you see a histogram, try to image the lookup table on the x-axis

that is usually the numbers 0 - 255

depending on software: 100 - 200 = 0, 100 - 200 = 155

100 + 200 = 255, 100 + 200 = 45

solution : when doing math with pixels, avoid bit-depth 8!!!
