an image processing filter is an operation on an image

filters do not do magic, they can not make things visible which are not in the image

it takes an image and produces a new image out of it

filters change pixel values

application examples: noise-reduction, artefact-removal, contrast enhancement, correct uneven illumination

noise is a general term for unwanted modifications that a signal may suffer during capture, storage, transmission, processing or conversion

in microscopy, including: read out noise, dark noise, shot noise, physical / optical effect, biological / physiological / structural effect

pixel intensity = target intensity + background + camera offset + noise

effects of noise can be reduced by longer exposure times at the price of other effects such as motion blur and phototoxicity

we need to remove the noise to help the computer interpreting the image, otherwise, it could not recongnise object

image with noise --- blurring --- thresholding --- recognization 

including methods of gaussian, median, 

linear filters replace each pixel value with a linear combination of surrounding pixels,
basically, linear filtering is a convolution,
it needs a kernel (weight template)
which will lead to a new image where each pixel is replaced by the weighted sum of pixel values in the neighbourhood.

kernels are matrices describing a linear filter.

we convolve an image with a kernel, convolution operator is * , like mean, gaussian, sobel

non-linear filters also replace pixel value inside as rolling window but in a non linear function, like min, median, max,
variance, and standard deviation.

edge detection might make sense to measure surfaces or follow structures which are located between birght and dark structures.

image --- median filter --- edge detection, 
nuclear envelope marked with lap2d-gfp + median filter 

microscopist may know fancy alternatives to computationa edge detection.

differentiating objects is easier if their background intensity is equal, via subtract background

extracted background --- substracted background or divided by background

in order to allow the computer analyzing individual objects in images, we need to segment and label them first, like thresholding + binary watershed
machine learning

pre-processing: before creating mask, need - noise removal via median filter, background substraction and contrast equivalisation

threshholding: to separate background from regions of interest by setting a minimum and / or minimun signal intensity as threshold

overblurring to improve thresholding results 
in case thresholding algorithms outline the wrong structure, blurring may help
however, do not continue processing blurring imshg, continue with the original.

do not enter a manual threshold, 
it is in general not reproducible and not objective.

chooose a theshold algorithm and stick to it for the whole study, 
if you select a new method for every image, the procedure is not reproducible and not objective.

there is no perfect method, there will be always this one image where thresholding fails.

binary mask image may not be perfect immediately after thresholding, 

thresholding --- binary closing --- binary opening

refining mask : erosion
every pixel with at least one black neighbour becomes black.

refining mask : dilation
every pixel with at least one white neighbour becomes white.

refining mask : erosion & dilation
combined methods allow correcting outlines

#############################################################################################################
refining masks : watershed
to cut connectedd objects, the watershed algorithm is a very powerful tool
on masks, we use the binary watershed
